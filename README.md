# Ggtd


## Introduction

Ggtd is yet  another "Get Things Done" app but using GNUstep. Another name should have been  : no one should have more than 60 tasks in mind (but it was a little bit to long). 

The aim of this small app is 
 * to have a complete view of all the pending tasks, 
 * to clearly indentify the length of the tasks avec the priority
 * to be efficient when creating a new task
 * and even more...

## How it works
 
This app has first being created using a sheet of paper and a eraser : I have drawn 3 columns labelled "today", "after", "to keep in mind" and I start to note my tasks according to these description. I decide that only one face of the sheet should have to be used and due to tha avalaible space and of the size of my writing only 20 lines could then be used. 

For each tasks and using symbols derived from bullets journal, I label each task with the following  symbols for the length :
* . : a short task
* o : an moderate task
* O : a long task

I added a symbol before the length symbol to described the state of the task :
* ! : urgent
* > : programmed
* < : started


I also plotted an horizontal line between the group of tasks on the same subject ("perso", "sport", etc.


I obtained finally a sheet with 60 tasks max classified in length, state and urgency. I decided to create the app when I was bore of erasing and rewriting one tasks from one column or row to another and changing the place of the horizontal line.

This method is this a mix of notation used in bullet journal and kanban.
